Procedural blocks and timing controls :

Delay controls.
Edge-Sensitive Event controls.
Level-Sensitive Event controls-Wait statements.
Named Events.

Delay Controls :

Delays the execution of a procedural statement by specific simulation time.

#< time > < statement >;

 	 	
Example - clk_gen :

module clk_gen();
reg clk,rst;

initial begin
$monitor(" Time = %g reset = %b clk = %b",$time,clk,rst);

clk = 0;
rst = 0;
#2 rst = 1;
#5 rst = 0;
#10 $finish();
end

always #1 clk = !clk;

endmodule

Output :

 Time = 0 reset = 0 clk = 0
 Time = 1 reset = 0 clk = 1
 Time = 2 reset = 1 clk = 0
 Time = 3 reset = 1 clk = 1
 Time = 4 reset = 1 clk = 0
 Time = 5 reset = 1 clk = 1
 Time = 6 reset = 1 clk = 0
 Time = 7 reset = 0 clk = 1
 Time = 8 reset = 0 clk = 0
 Time = 9 reset = 0 clk = 1
 Time = 10 reset = 0 clk = 0
 Time = 11 reset = 0 clk = 1
 Time = 12 reset = 0 clk = 0
 Time = 13 reset = 0 clk = 1
 Time = 14 reset = 0 clk = 0
 Time = 15 reset = 0 clk = 1
 Time = 16 reset = 0 clk = 0

Edge sensitive Event Controls : 

Delays execution of the next statement until the specified transition on a signal.

syntax : @ (< posedge >|< negedge > signal) < statement >;
