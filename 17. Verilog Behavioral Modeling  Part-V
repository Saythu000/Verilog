	Procedural Block Control
Procedural blocks become active at simulation time zero. Use level sensitive event controls to control the execution of a procedure.

module dlatch_using_always();

reg q;
reg enable,d;

always(d or enable) begin
if(enable) begin
q = d;
end
end
initial begin
$monitor($time,"enable = %b data = %b q = %b",enable,d,q);
#10 enable =0; 
#10 d = 1;
#10 enable = 1; 
#10 d= 0;
#10 d = 1;
#10 d = 0;
#10 enable = 0;
#10 $finish();
end
endmodule

	
Any change in either d or enable satisfies the event control and allows the execution of the statements in the procedure. The procedure is sensitive to any change in d or enable.
