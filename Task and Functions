Task and Functions

When repeating the same old things again and again, Verilog, like any other programming language, provides means to address repeated used code, these are called Tasks and Functions. I wish I had something similar for webpages, just call it to print this programming language stuff again and again.
Code below is used for calculating even parity.
function parity;
input [31:0] data;
integer i;
begin
  parity = 0;
  for (i= 0; i < 32; i = i + 1) begin
    parity = parity ^ data[i];
  end
end
endfunction
Functions and tasks have the same syntax; one difference is that tasks can have delays, whereas functions can not have any delay. This means that function can be used for modeling combinational logic.
	
A second difference is that functions can return a value, whereas tasks can not.
